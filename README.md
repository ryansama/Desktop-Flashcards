# SharpCards


SharpCards is a desktop app built with C# and Windows Forms. It allows the user to create, store, and read two-sided flashcards. The user can organize their cards using groups. The code that runs the processes within the applciation are located in [Form1.cs](https://github.com/ryansama/SharpCards/blob/master/Desktop%20Flashcards/Form1.cs).

#### Usage

1. Download SharpCards.exe and MaterialSkin.dll [here](https://github.com/ryansama/SharpCards/releases). 

2. Run SharpCards.exe!

#### The Console Application

Prior to building this Windows Forms program, we built [a skeleton console application](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App) to test functionality, data structures and efficiency. 

#### Material Design

We are interested in building this desktop app with components of [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). A big thanks goes to [Ignace Maes](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes) who created a [Material Design skin for WinForms](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin), which we are using in the app.
